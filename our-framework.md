Our Framework 

The Theory Behind the Test
The foundation of the FPRT is built on decades of research and insights from leading psychological and sociological theories. Its design is informed by three core frameworks:
1.	Family Systems Theory: This theory highlights the interdependence of individuals within a relational system. It asserts that dysfunction in one area - such as communication - can ripple across the entire relationship, triggering conflict and dissatisfaction in seemingly unrelated areas.
2.	Attachment Theory: Groundbreaking work in attachment theory by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth underscored the importance of trust, emotional security, and reliability. The FPRT incorporates these principles by assessing how deficits in trust and loyalty impact other pillars, such as communication and shared goals.
3.	Behavioral-Cognitive Models: These models explore the tangible behaviors and thought patterns that influence relational outcomes. For example, conflict resolution styles, emotional disclosure, and active listening are key elements of the FPRT’s Communication & Conversation Culture pillar.
By integrating these theoretical perspectives, the FPRT provides a scientifically rigorous yet practical framework for understanding and improving relationships. Its emphasis on synergy - the interplay between strengths and weaknesses - makes it particularly effective in capturing the complexity of real-life partnerships.

The Four Pillars
1. Common Values, Goals, & Dreams
This pillar examines how well partners align on foundational life philosophies, future plans, and individual ambitions. Shared values and goals form the bedrock of long-term relational stability, influencing everything from day-to-day decisions to major life milestones.
•	Shared Future Plans: Couples are evaluated on their ability to align on long-term objectives, such as marriage, parenthood, career aspirations, and lifestyle choices. Discrepancies in these areas can lead to chronic tension and unmet expectations if left unresolved.
•	Life Philosophy Congruence: This sub-area addresses deeper existential and moral questions, including religious beliefs, ethical stances, and cultural values. Even minor misalignments in life philosophy can intensify over time, particularly when partners interpret differences as incompatibility or disrespect.
•	Individual Goal Support: A healthy relationship requires mutual encouragement and support for each partner’s personal ambitions. This sub-area evaluates whether partners champion each other’s career goals, creative pursuits, and personal growth, or whether envy and sabotage undermine their connection.
A low score in this pillar often manifests as repeated arguments, feelings of resentment, and a lack of shared vision for the future. By addressing these issues, couples can create a more cohesive and fulfilling partnership.

2. Sexuality
Sexual satisfaction and intimacy are crucial components of a healthy relationship. This pillar evaluates both the emotional and physical aspects of a couple’s sexual connection, recognizing that dissatisfaction in this domain often spills over into other areas.
•	Frequency & Desire Alignment: Mismatched libidos or unmet expectations around sexual frequency can lead to frustration and feelings of rejection. This sub-area assesses how well partners align in their desires and whether they can negotiate compromises.
•	Intimacy & Emotional Connection: Beyond physical acts, this sub-area explores the emotional depth of sexual encounters. A strong connection fosters trust, vulnerability, and closeness, while a lack of intimacy can make the relationship feel transactional or disconnected.
•	Communication About Sexual Needs: Open dialogue about preferences, boundaries, and fantasies is essential for maintaining a fulfilling sexual relationship. Couples who struggle to communicate in this area often experience unresolved tensions that erode trust and satisfaction.
When scores in the Sexuality pillar fall below the critical threshold, couples may face escalating resentment, withdrawal, or even infidelity. Addressing these issues through open communication and mutual understanding can significantly improve relational health.

3. Communication & Conversation Culture
Effective communication is the lifeblood of any successful relationship. This pillar evaluates how couples navigate conflicts, express emotions, and engage in proactive maintenance of their partnership.
•	Conflict Resolution Skills: Inspired by John Gottman’s research, this sub-area examines how couples handle disagreements. It assesses whether they use constructive approaches like calm dialogue and repair attempts or fall into destructive patterns like criticism, contempt, and defensiveness.
•	Emotional Disclosure & Listening: Open and empathetic communication fosters trust and intimacy. This sub-area evaluates whether partners feel safe sharing their vulnerabilities and whether they actively listen to and validate each other’s emotions.
•	Regular Check-Ins & Maintenance: Proactive communication, such as scheduling regular discussions about relationship goals and concerns, helps prevent small issues from escalating into major conflicts. This sub-area assesses a couple’s ability to maintain relational health through intentional dialogue.
Low scores in communication often exacerbate other relational issues, making it difficult for couples to address challenges effectively. By improving communication skills, couples can create a more supportive and harmonious partnership.

4. Trust & Loyalty
Trust is the foundation upon which all healthy relationships are built. This pillar assesses a couple’s emotional security, reliability, and adherence to agreed-upon boundaries.
•	Boundaries & Respect: Healthy relationships require mutual respect for personal autonomy and boundaries. This sub-area evaluates whether partners exhibit controlling or intrusive behaviors that undermine trust.
•	Reliability & Fidelity: Day-to-day consistency and adherence to commitments are crucial for building trust. This sub-area assesses whether partners follow through on promises and remain faithful if monogamy is a shared expectation.
•	Emotional Security & Transparency: Open and honest communication about insecurities, fears, and vulnerabilities is essential for fostering trust. Low scores in this area indicate secrecy or judgment, which can corrode the relationship over time.
A severe deficiency in trust often leads to jealousy, emotional distance, and escalating conflict. By addressing these issues, couples can rebuild a foundation of security and reliability.

Synergy and Thresholds
The FPRT’s scoring system is designed to reflect the reality that relationships are not defined by averages alone. Instead, the test uses a threshold-based penalty system to account for the outsized impact of severe deficiencies in any one domain. For example:
•	A score below 4.0 in any pillar triggers a penalty, reducing the overall composite score to reflect the real-world consequences of that deficiency.
•	If multiple pillars fall below threshold, additional penalties are applied to capture the compounded impact of overlapping weaknesses.
This approach mirrors the dynamics of real relationships, where a single “deal-breaker” issue - such as a lack of trust - can undermine even strong performance in other areas.

Personal Traits and Expanded Dimensions
In addition to the four pillars, the FPRT considers individual traits that influence how partners navigate relational challenges. Attributes like empathy, emotional stability, and adaptability can either mitigate or exacerbate pillar deficiencies, providing a more nuanced understanding of a couple’s dynamics.
For instance, a high level of empathy may help partners navigate conflicts with greater compassion, while low emotional stability can intensify even minor disagreements. By incorporating these traits, the FPRT offers tailored insights into how each partner contributes to the overall relationship dynamic.

Predicting Relationship Outcomes
The FPRT goes beyond diagnosing the current state of a relationship - it also provides a forward-looking assessment of its future trajectory. By combining pillar scores, personal traits, and synergy-based penalties, the test predicts the likelihood of future distress or dissolution. This predictive capability empowers couples to take proactive steps to address vulnerabilities and strengthen their connection.
For example, a couple with low scores in both Communication and Trust may face a 60% risk of significant conflict or breakup within the next year unless targeted interventions are implemented. This data-driven approach helps couples and clinicians prioritize efforts to improve relational health.

Why the FPRT Matters
The FPRT stands out as a transformative tool for couples, therapists, and researchers. Its unique combination of breadth, depth, and predictive accuracy makes it an invaluable resource for understanding and improving relationships. By identifying critical weaknesses, fostering self-awareness, and guiding targeted interventions, the FPRT helps couples build stronger, more fulfilling partnerships. Whether you’re navigating the early stages of a relationship or seeking to revitalize a long-term commitment, the FPRT provides the insights and tools needed to thrive.

Project Objective
To build an advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that goes beyond basic user authentication. The system will provide a sophisticated authorization framework with multi-tiered user roles, comprehensive user management, and extensive features for content management. The core focus is on security, scalability, and user experience, implementing features ranging from multi-provider authentication to advanced admin capabilities like user impersonation and system-wide management tools.

o	Edge Runtime support
2.	Supabase (Backend as a Service)
o	PostgreSQL database
o	Authentication services
o	Real-time subscriptions
o	Storage for media files
o	Row Level Security (RLS)
3.	Shadcn UI (Component Library)
o	Customizable components
o	Accessible by default
o	Type-safe components
o	Tailwind CSS integration
4.	Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS Framework)

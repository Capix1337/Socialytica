Project Objective
To build an advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that goes beyond basic user authentication. The system will provide a sophisticated authorization framework with multi-tiered user roles, comprehensive user management, and extensive features for content management. The core focus is on security, scalability, and user experience, implementing features ranging from multi-provider authentication to advanced admin capabilities like user impersonation and system-wide management tools.

This is the plan base on our last conversation. 

we have done step 1, 2, and 5, which leaves step 3 and 4 . You can confirm this on the work space to see the files we currently have.

Based on your workspace, I'll help plan the admin dashboard's test creation feature. Let's break it down into steps:

1. Update Schema (prisma/schema.prisma):

2. Create API Routes:

3. Admin Dashboard UI (app/(dashboards)/admindash/tests/page.tsx/admindash/tests/page.tsx)):

- List of tests with status (published/draft)
- Create/Edit test button
- Test management actions (publish, unpublish, delete)

4. Test Creation Form (app/(dashboards)/admindash/tests/new/page.tsx/admindash/tests/new/page.tsx)):

5. Components Needed:
TestList - Table showing all tests
TestForm - Form for test details
QuestionEditor - Component for managing questions
QuestionForm - Form for individual questions
OptionsEditor - Component for managing question options

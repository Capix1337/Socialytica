This is a next.js app router project. I have already done the basic setup of setting up the following:
a database using prisma, 
shadcn ui, for components,
tailwind css, 
clerk for authentication
etc.

Now lets plan out the admin dasboard section. first we will be adding this feature.

ability of an admin to publish a test to the database. This means writting a model for test on our schema.prisma file, writing a types/test.ts file for our types.
create our api routes for post, get and delete requests to and from the database. 
work on other technical aspects like the design etc. 

Ok lets talk about how it would look.

I don't know yet you can advice on the best approach and design, however I do have a rough idea. The admin can create multiple test

lets take for example if one of the test is . Relationship Health Assessment

we will discus other aspects later, for now lets concentrate on the test Questions
please write out a plan for me if you have any question feel free to ask.
